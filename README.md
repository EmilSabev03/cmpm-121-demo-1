-ChatGPT and MDN helped with step 5:  
Prompted chatgpt to show me how to set up the button

-ChatGPT helped with step 6:
Prompted chatgpt to show me an example of how to set up growthrate and count buttons

-ChatGPT helped with step 8:
asked chatgpt how to include an image as the main button for my game

-Step 9/Step 10, used a lot of for loop + array refactoring.
Instead of declaring multiple variables for all the items, I used for loops + object arrays to declare variables.
Learned about it through sites like this:

-D1.d First change:
Drew inspiration from Jackie's title bounce animation and modified it to so that my pizza clicker title sways up and down:
