-ChatGPT helped with step 8:

-Step 9/Step 10, used a lot of for loop + array refactoring.
Instead of declaring multiple variables for all the items, I used for loops + object arrays to declare variables.
Learned about it through sites like this:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-iterate-array-of-objects-in-typescript/

-D1.d First change:
